\begin{abstract}
One of the main topics in complex systems studies concerns the traffic congestion prediction as a consequence of the increasing number of vehicles. We propose a novel pipeline to classify slowdowns situations processing data by the analysis of the features related to the fundamental diagram of traffic. We train a deep learning neural network providing a forewarning time of prediction related to the training set size. Then we compare our performances with those of the most common classifiers used in machine learning analysis.

%Traffic behavior prediction is fundamental to alleviate traffic congestions. We propose to classify the slowdowns situations analyzing the fundamental diagram of traffic
%which gives a relation between the traffic flow and the traffic density. A traffic congestion
%occurs when the density of the road grows up and the flow decreases. In order to predict
%congestion situations, we train the Replicated Focusing Belief Propagation architecture processing data according to the fundamental diagram of traffic.

\section{Introduction}
Understanding the daily traffic evolution is a fundamental actual topic since traffic congestions have become an integral part of our modern life and are cause of wasted fuel, air pollution and billions of wasted dollars in each year. It induces people to plan more time when travel bringing longer trip times and affecting the quality of life. Therefore research is attempting to handle this problem
or at least ease its adverse effects \cite{ZCW14,YB15}, also from the artificial intelligence point of view \cite{TG06, NT04, YR06, TMP07, SAB08}. There are several research methods used in the field of traffic prediction like deterministic, non-deterministic and stochastic \cite{C03} methods. Traditional studies have developed simulation techniques to model traffic congestion dynamics \cite{K13}, but many approaches have limitations, mainly due to errors during the calibration process of parameters and unrealistic assumptions. Besides the classification, our approach trains a deep learning algorithm to forecast traffic slowdowns and provide a forewarning time of prediction. 

Deep learning techniques \cite{NC11} are considered some of the most promising techniques to process huge high-dimensional data. The Binary Committee Machine Replicated Focusing Belief Propagation neural network (RFBP) is an iterative message-passing method that can be used to
describe a probability distribution over an instance described by a factor graph in the correlation decay approximation. We use this method with binary inputs which have been obtained by a collection of traffic road data. Data have been recorded by loop magnetic traffic detectors provided by Emilia Romagna region. Detectors record every car passing and generate an high time resolutions amount of data.

Many studies have been performed to estimate the urban traffic congestion and to implement prediction methods \cite{VKG14,HA15,ER15,DXSZ15,YDL15, CHW11, LYHVS11, PWM08}, focusing on various different features of classification. We present a method which is based on the study of the evolution of traffic flow, density and speed which are related through the fundamental diagram of traffic.  

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The second section presents a description of the dataset and of our method of prediction. The third section describes our performances results making a comparison with other common classifiers. The fourth section concludes the paper.

\section{Materials and Method}
In this section, we describe the set of the data we deal with and our congestion prediction method, which involves the analysis of the fundamental diagram of traffic.

In order to effectively train the model to make forecasts under regular-congestion conditions which rise from car and road situations, a big set of past data is necessary for analysis. The car data have been collected by Emilia Romagna region over a period of one month (May 2011). The data are measured every time a car overcross a detector which records round-the-clock timestamp informations about direction, lane and driving speed. Processing mentioned data, we focus on two car dynamics features: the traffic flow and the vehicle density which are related according to the fundamental diagram of traffic (Figure \ref{diagram}) in homogeneous steady conditions.
Such quantities are defined as a function of a fixed number of cars: ...  which drive in a time interval and as the product between the flow and the car speed.

In order to avoid traffic congestion and to keep the traffic flow stable, the number of vehicles that enter the road must be smaller or equal than the number of vehicles that leaves it. At low traffic densities, where interactions among vehicles are rare, the flow grows nearly linearly with the density until a critical density value is reached, at which the flow reaches the road capacity taking its maximum value. In this situation the flow decreases as the density increases producing a queue of cars (figure \ref{densityflow}). 

%In figure \ref{diagram} we can visualize different traffic behaviors: we show the fundamental diagrams with respect two different daily situations. 

We first preprocess the data in order to eliminate noisy sample points, of which perceived positions are not consistent. In the second step we have to digitalize our signal according to the informations coming from the fundamental diagram structure. This is due to the theoretical model linked to the RFBP \cite{BB16, BB15} which can be used to derive marginal probabilities on a system within the Bethe-Peierls approximation and works with binarized input arrays. It is not well understood how this deep learning method is able to learn and how it doesn't get trapped in configurations with low computational performance. In order to classify slowdowns we apply a fuzzy binarization to the data and we associate to each car the value $-1$ or $+1$ as follows. We identify a slowdown occurrence when the road density is greater than the daily average road density and the traffic flow is decreasing. 
Using this definition we binarize the informations associating to each car the number $+ 1$ if it is involved in a slowdown either $-1$.
Thirdly we split each daily sequence into subsets of arbitrary length which produce a different time interval of prediction. Up to now we label each subset applying a majority rule to the values of the following subarray. In figure \ref{binary} we represent an example of the results of our processing. We highlight in the first two panels time regions of traffic flow and density which are responsible of congestion situations, then we represent in the third graph the result of our labelling \textbf{(sistemare bene l'ultima frase)}.

The flow grows linearly with the density of the road without reaching the critical point so that it can be approximated by the density. Right panel: congested day, the diagram presents a cloud of points stemming from the line. After the road has reached its maximal capability, density continues to grow while the car speed, so the flow, decreases. }\label{diagram}

\section{Results and Performances}
To benchmark our results and validate our approach, we compare our performances of prediction with those of ten other classifiers, namely KNeighbors (KNN), linear Support Vector Machine (lSVM), RBF Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Process, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), MLP, AdaBoost (AB), Gaussian NB, QDA. 

As performances estimator we use the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), i.e. the trapezoidal approximation of the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. The AUC corresponds to the probability that the classifier ranks a positive instance against a negative one. 
We represent in figure \ref{auc} the comparison of AUC values.

\caption{Comparison of AUC values.}\label{auc}
\end{figure}

Secondly we analyze the Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) which provides a balanced measure of the quality of binary classification taking into account true and false, positive and negatives even if classes have very different sizes. The MCC can take values in the range $[-1, +1]$.
The value +1 represent a total right classification, the value -1 a complete disagreement of prediction and the value 0 is associated to a random classifier.
We represent in figure \ref{mcc} the comparison of MCC values.
